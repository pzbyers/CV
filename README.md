# CV Project

## About

This project focussed on creating a single-page CV (Curriculum Vitae) using only HTML.

The main tasks were to create the webpage using semantically correct HTML, use suitable SEO tags and include a favicon.  The project also served as a good introduction to styling a webpage using CSS.
